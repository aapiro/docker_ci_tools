# Docker ci/cd play tools
A custom docker imagen for a development enviroment of [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). I used some original files from  [docker](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker)  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) repository to create it. Yes! Yes! I KNOW IT! this is another jenkins image in docker ... but this one includes little toys that will make your life easier to get into "DevOps' World".
